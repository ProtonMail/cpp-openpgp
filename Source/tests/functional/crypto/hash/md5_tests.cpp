            // previous and subsequent triples. If, for a given set of input bytes, the number is not an even multiple of 3,
            // the remaining 1 or two bytes are encoded and padded using '=' characters at the end. The encoding format is
            // defined by IETF RFC 4648. Such padding is only allowed at the end of a encoded string, which makes it impossible
            // to generally concatenate encoded strings and wind up with a string that is a valid base64 encoding.
            //
            // Since each triple of bytes is independent of others, we don't have to test particularly large sets if input data,
            // validating that the algorithm can process at least two triples should be sufficient.
