# Update procedure

Make sure you have `djinni` installed

## No new code file generated

### In OpenPGP repo

1. Update `open_pgp.djinni` with all the interfaces and method you need
2. Run `OpenPGP/Scripts/bridge/build_bridge.sh`
3. Let the class inherit from the auto-generated classes. e.g. let `Photo` class inherit from `IPhoto` class (donâ€™t forget to update the include file!)
4. Under `ProtonMail` namespace, implement the methods created in the auto-generated interface class. e.g. implement `IPhoto` class methods under `ProtonMail` namespace
5. Compile the framework for iOS using `build_pgp_ios_universal.sh` 

## New code file generated

### In OpenPGP repo

1. In the `Build phase` tab, add the newly generated files in `copy file` list
2. In folder `OpenPGPlib/ezvcard`, add those new documents to the target

### In ProtonMail iOS repo

1. Run `pod install --no-repo-update`
